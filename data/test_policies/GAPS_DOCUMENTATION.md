## Expected Gap Analysis Output

The LLM-based gap analysis should identify most or all of these gaps and provide:
1. Specific gap descriptions aligned with NIST CSF requirements
2. Severity/priority ratings for each gap
3. Recommendations for addressing each gap
4. Revised policy sections incorporating missing elements
5. Implementation roadmap aligned with NIST framework
